# 🚀 ProductCo Ad Hoc SQL Analytics Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project simulates **real-world ad hoc analytics** in a **product-based SaaS company**, solving advanced business problems using SQL on a dataset of **2M+ transactions**.  

The focus is on **end-to-end analytics**:  
- Schema design (fact + dimension tables)  
- Ad hoc SQL queries (advanced CTEs, window functions, cohorts, churn detection)  
- Insights + recommendations

## 🏗️ Schema Design  
Star Schema with Fact + Dimension tables:  

- **Dimension Tables**  
  - `dim_users`  
  - `dim_products`

  - `dim_regions`  
  - `dim_subscription_plans`  
  - `dim_time`  

- **Fact Tables**  
  - `fact_events` (usage logs)  
  - `fact_payments`  
  - `fact_feedback`  
  - `fact_upgrades`  
  - `fact_cohorts`
